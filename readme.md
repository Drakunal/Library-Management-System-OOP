# Library Management System to demonstrate the usage of OOP in python
Notebook files named #1 to #7 are based on the coursera course of Python essentials for MLOps by Duke University.
The Basic Library Management System shows the concepts of OOP in use in python.
The Enhanced version helps to save the state in the form of a pickle file and is able to handle multiple users as well. This is purely for the demonstration of OOP in python and in reality, you should be creating a database, so that concurrent access can also be handled.
